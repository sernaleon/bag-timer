## Features

### ⏱️ Timer Engine
- Configurable **warmup**, **round**, and **rest** durations (in seconds)
- Up to **40 rounds** per session
- Live countdown with total session time always visible
- Bell sound at every phase transition
- **Pause / Resume** mid-session
- **Screen Wake Lock** — prevents the display from sleeping during training (Chrome/Safari)

### 🥊 Combo System
- **Markov-chain combo generator** — produces realistic boxing combinations on the fly using weighted transitions between all 8 punches:
  - `1` JAB (L) · `2` CROSS (R) · `3` HOOK (L) · `4` HOOK (R)
  - `5` UPPER (L) · `6` UPPER (R) · `7` OVER (L) · `8` OVER (R)
- Combos favour realistic boxing flow: jab as opener, left–right alternation, power shots as finishers
- Variable length: 2–8 punches, weighted toward 3–5
- **"Up Next"** preview: during warmup and rest the next round's combo is shown dimmed so you can visualise it before the bell

### 🎛️ Combo Editor (Settings Screen)
- Pre-generates one combo per round before you start
- Edit any combo before the session:
  - **Click a badge** → cycles through all 8 punch types
  - **Hover → ×** → removes that punch
  - **+** button → adds the next logical punch
  - **↺** per row → randomises that round
  - **↺ Shuffle all** → regenerates all combos at once
- **Drag & drop** to reorder rounds (grab any row and drop it anywhere)
- All edits are saved instantly

### 💾 Persistence
- Settings and combos are **auto-saved to localStorage** on every change
- Everything is restored exactly as you left it on next visit
- **Reset** button wipes localStorage and restores all defaults (6 rounds, 10 s warmup, 180 s round, 30 s rest)

### 📺 Picture-in-Picture
- **PiP button** mirrors the entire workout view into a floating window
- Lets you keep the timer visible while watching tutorials, music, or anything else on screen

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Fluid punch cards scale with container width using CSS Container Queries (`cqi` units)
- Works from a quarter-width browser window up to full widescreen
- No horizontal scroll at any size, even with 8-punch combos
- Tested on MacBook Air M1 (Chrome) at small window sizes
